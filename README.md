# What is it?
This is command line java password generator. The basic function is to generate a password for the user per their requests. The program initially prompts the user for the desired length of their password, it must be between 12 and 20 characters to be valid. The program then asks the user what to include in the the password letter pool, first asking if letters should be included,then numbers and symbols. These charachters are then added to the pool of possible characters and then iterated over to create a strong password.

# Why did I make it?
I made this project over winter break to continue working on my programming skills, spefically in Java.

# What do I want to add?
I want to add a GUI to this project to make it more like a typical app, I think with the additon of this the program would become something amazing and something I can use on a frequent basis since I am always generating strong passwords to use for accounts I sign up for online. I also wish to be able to package as a full fledged java application using jpackage so it is something that I could share with others so they can use it.
